            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website! I'm an urban ecologist based in Chicago focused on using acoustic monitoring, spatial ecology, and community science to better understand wildlife relationships in urban ecosystems. While the majority of my research surrounds acoustic monitoring of birds and bats I am always interested in collaborating on novel projects. Feel free to get in contact!</p>
            <p>Beyond just my science, I'm an educator and naturalist with a strong passion for scientific outreach. In my spare time I like to bird, work in my garden, and hike. Check out the blog and sightings tabs to learn more about what I get up to outside of science and education!</p>

            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>My research is focused on better understanding wildlife in urban ecosystems through passive acoustic monitoring and community science. While most of my current experience lies in bat and bird acoustic monitoring, I am interested in expanding my research into other passive monitoring systems. I am also driven by my love for community science and cherish nothing more than connecting new folks to their local wildlife through research. Below are the main three main themes that guide my work!</p>

                <h3>Acoustic Monitoring</h3>
                <p>While wildlife research is undoubtably crucial in the conservation and our understanding of some species. Some wildlife monitoring methods can be rather invasive, often forcing ecologists to weigh the pros and cons of such research. With passive acoustic monitoring there are minimal such concerns. This allows us to survey species in wild locations, at crazy times, and for a longer term than one individual could monitor.</p>
                <p>I use autonomous recording units (ARUs) to study aerial wildlife including bats and birds. This requires knowledge of bat and bird call identification, data processing using acoustic programs such as Sonobat, Kaleidoscope, Audacity, and Cornell's BirdNet. Beyond this I apply acoustic monitoring data to RStudio and GIS workflows in order to tell stories about how urban wildlife interacts with the cities we live in.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Spatial Analysis</h3>
                <p>Since a kid I have always been infatuated with maps and geography. Fond memories of leading my family around trail systems and charting the woods behind our house developed into what is now a strong affinity for answering my research questions through spatial analysis. With growing skills in QGIS, ArcGISPro, and R, I am excited to see where my love for spatial analysis and visualization leads me!</p>
                <p>My current spatial work surrounds using LiDAR data to analyze tree height and canopy in local Chicago parks. This landscape analysis in tandem with volunteer collected acoustic bat data will inform future urban planning decisions and our understanding of bats in urban ecosystems.</p>

            <!-- Community Science Subsection -->
            <div class="ri-subsection-container">

                </div>
                <h3>Community Science</h3>
                <p>My strong belief that building strong communities in turn supports local wildlife informs my passion for community science. From creating new relationships, to hearing the public's anecdotal wildlife evidence, I really enjoy spending time in volunteer cohorts as an ecologist. The pros of community science are unmistakable and I am so glad the field is growing so rapidly!</p>
                <p>Most of my experience in the community science and volunteer monitoring experience comes from my time as the Community Science Coordinator for the Bat Tracker program. This is a program that led by the assistant director at the Urban Wildlife Institute where volunteers collect acoustic bat data at their local green space. This was an amazing opportunity and truly solidified my love for community science! Check out an article describing my work on this project here!</p>

                <h2>Education & Outreach</h2>
                <p>I am committed to sharing my love for wildlife and ecological research with anyone who will listen! Whether I'm leading educational events, wildlife walks, presentations, or tabling, I connect Chicago communities with nature in order to grow urban environmental literacy and spark curiosity for local wildlife!</p>
